### Dataset Description: 
The dataset in question is related to Instacart and was initially released for a Kaggle competition in 2017. While the original dataset is no longer available on the Instacart website, modified CSV files have been created for the project. These files contain a reduced version of the original dataset, with changes made to enhance computational efficiency, such as size reduction and the introduction of missing and duplicate values. The modifications aimed to maintain the original data's distributions.

### Project Objective: 
The main objective of the project is to clean up the provided data and generate a report that offers insights into the shopping habits of Instacart customers. The analysis is expected to involve answering specific questions, and for each question, the results should be presented in a Jupyter notebook with accompanying plots. The plots are required to have proper titles, labeled axes, legends if necessary, and each plot cell should end with plt.show().

### Tasks Involved: 
The tasks include cleaning up the data, conducting analyses, and creating visualizations to communicate the findings effectively. The report should be structured in a Jupyter notebook, with explanations provided in markdown cells after answering each question.
